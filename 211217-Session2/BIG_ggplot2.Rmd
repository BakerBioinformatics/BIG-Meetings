# Introduction

```

GGPlot2 is an R package for producing elegant statistical, or data, graphics piece by piece.

::: remember
The gg means Grammar of Graphics, a graphic concept which describes plots by using a “grammar”
:::

According to the ggplot2 concept, a plot can be divided into three different fundamental parts: 

* Data: Information that you want to visualise
* Aesthetics: Indicate variables to be used, color, size, shape, ...
* Geometry: Indicate the type of graphics (points, box plots, bar plot, ...)

GGPlot2 is designed to work in layers. In brief, the ggplot2 tells us that a graphic maps the **data** to the **aesthetic** (aes) attributes (colour, shape, size) of **geometric** objects (points, lines, bars). Note that, you can keep enhancing the plot by adding more layers (and themes) to an existing plot created using the ggplot() function.
